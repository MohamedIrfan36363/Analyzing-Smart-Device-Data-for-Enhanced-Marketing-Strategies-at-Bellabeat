# How many unique participants are there in each dataframe? 
# It looks like there may be more participants in the daily activity

# What are some quick summary statistics we'd want to know about each data frame?

# For the daily activity dataframe:

daily_activity %>% 
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         SedentaryMinutes) %>%
  summary()

# For the sleep dataframe:

sleep_day %>%

         TotalMinutesAsleep,
         TotalTimeInBed) %>%

# What does this tell us about how this sample of people's activities?

## Plotting a few explorations ##

# What's the relationship between steps taken in a day and sedentary minutes? 
# How could this help inform the customer segments that we can market to? 
# E.g. position this more as a way to get started in walking more? 
# Or to measure steps that you're already taking?

ggplot(data=daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=SedentaryMinutes)) + geom_point()


# What's the relationship between minutes asleep and time in bed? 
# You might expect it to be almost completely linear - are there any unexpected trends?


ggplot(data=sleep_day, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) + geom_point()


# What could these trends tell you about how to help market this product? Or areas where you might want to explore further?

## Merging these two datasets together ##
##################################

combined_data <- merge(sleep_day, daily_activity, by="Id")

# Take a look at how many participants are in this data set.


n_distinct(combined_data$Id)


# Note that there were more participant Ids in the daily activity 
# dataset that have been filtered out using merge. Consider using 'outer_join' 
# to keep those in the dataset. 

# Now you can explore some different relationships between activity and sleep as well. 
# For example, do you think participants who sleep more also take more steps or fewer 
# steps per day? Is there a relationship at all? How could these answers help inform 
# the marketing strategy of how you position this new product?

# This is just one example of how to get started with this data - there are many other 
# files and questions to explore as well!
